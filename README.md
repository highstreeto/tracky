# :timer_clock: Tracky

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/highstreeto/tracky.svg)](https://github.com/highstreeto/tracky/blob/master/LICENSE)

A simple time tracker implemented in Rust.

This a sandbox project for me to get acquainted with Rust. Don't except any *fancy* features!

## Layout

- `tracky`: Library for time tracking
- `tracky-cli`: REPL client for tracky
- `tracky-gui`: GUI client based on [Azul](https://azul.rs/)
